# Development Documentation

This directory contains development-specific documentation for the HTWG Grade Calculator. 

The requirements file was developed in collaboration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The implementation was carried out in VS Code using Claude Sonnet 4 as the coding agent. This project is my first experiment in what I would describe as spec-driven rapid coding — a workflow where the implementation follows a clearly written specification, with the help of an AI assistant.

## Phase Documentation

- [Phase 1](phase1.md) - Basic file upload and grade calculation
- [Phase 2](phase2.md) - Interactive sliders and thresholds
- [Phase 3](phase3.md) - Charts and visualizations
- [Phase 4](phase4.md) - ID matching and university submission workflow

## Development Resources

- [Restart Prompt](restart_prompt.md) - Development prompts and context

## Project Structure

The main application is in the root directory as `index.html` - a single-page web application that implements all phases progressively.
